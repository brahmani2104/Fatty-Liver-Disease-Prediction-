# Fatty Liver Disease Prediction System

Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a widespread health concern characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver cells. Early detection and prediction of FLD are crucial for preventing disease progression and reducing associated complications. This project aims to explore the application of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of FLD based on various clinical features obtained through Liver function tests.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable FLD risk assessment tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early intervention and accurate diagnosis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a predictive model that can analyze patient data and provide risk predictions for FLD. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the management of liver diseases by enabling personalized and proactive healthcare strategies.

## Dataset
We utilize a comprehensive dataset containing information on patient age, gender, and various liver function test parameters. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating our machine learning models. By using a large and diverse dataset, we aim to create robust models that can generalize well to unseen data and diverse patient populations.

## Existing System
The existing systems for FLD prediction face several limitations. These include a limited dataset size, which can restrict the models' performance and generalizability. Additionally, the lack of model diversity in existing systems limits the exploration of different machine learning algorithms that may be more effective for FLD prediction. Data cleaning and preprocessing are also critical areas that need improvement in existing systems to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Proposed System
In our proposed system, we address the limitations of existing systems by using a larger and more diverse dataset. This allows us to explore a wider range of machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to assess their performance in predicting FLD. We also focus on developing a user-friendly interface or decision support system that healthcare professionals can use to input patient data and receive FLD risk predictions. External validation of the developed models is another crucial aspect of our proposed system, ensuring their generalizability and reliability in real-world applications.

## Methodology
Our methodology involves several key steps, including identifying and gathering relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms, training the models on the training data, assessing the models on the testing dataset, and evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics. This systematic approach ensures that our models are robust, accurate, and reliable for FLD prediction.
