# Fatty-Liver-Disease-Prediction-
Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a serious condition. Early detection is crucial. Our project uses machine learning to predict FLD from liver function test. We aim to create a reliable risk assessment tool. This could revolutionize enabling early interventions and improving patient outcomes by using  patientâ€™s age, gender and various liver functions.
